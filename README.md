## Dash Express tech preview
This repository contains a work-in-progress technical preview of Dash Express. Dash Express is a project to significantly expand the capabilities of the Dash callback decorator. This project is beginning it's life as a separate package that depends on Dash, but the goal is that the successful ideas from this project will migrate into Dash as part of Dash 2.0.

Demos are located in the [docs/demos](./docs/demos) directory.
